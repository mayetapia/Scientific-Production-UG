## Intoduction
Universities are institutions where the research is a crucial piece to measure their prestige; hence, the importance to evaluate their scientific production. [SPAR  (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontology Network] (http://www.sparontologies.net/) is a complete pro-ject to describe the scholarly publishing domain. We used Spar Ontology Networ in order to inquire whether it is possible to represent the scientific production of the universities as well. We selected the University of Guayaquil as a case of study. The next figure explain the process carried out.
